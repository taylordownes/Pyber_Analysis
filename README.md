# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
This mock analysis is based on the analysis of ride-sharing data provided by a ride-sharing company app called Pyber. We were provided with city and ride data from January to early May 2019 to group and analyze by city. The Pyber challenge analysis contains the following deliverables:

- A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

### Resources
- data: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- analysis: Pyber_challenge.ipynb


## Results

### Pyber Summary DataFrame

Based on these results we determined that:
- Urban cities have the highest total rides, drivers, and fares
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver
- Suburban city totals and averages aare average overall compared to urban and rural cities

### Based on these results we determined that:
- Urban cities have a consistently high fare overtime
- Rural city fares remain consistently low with their lowest total fares occuring in the middle/end of January.
- Suburban city fares remain at an average fare rate compared to urban and rural cities and experienced a slight drop in total fares in late February.


## Summary: Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
