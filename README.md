# Pyber_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
This mock analysis is based on the analysis of ride-sharing data provided by a ride-sharing company app called Pyber. We were provided with city and ride data from January to early May 2019 to group and analyze by city. The Pyber challenge analysis consists the following deliverables:

- A ride-sharing summary DataFrame by city type
- A multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type

### Resources
- data: ride_data.csv, city_data.csv
- analysis: Pyber_challenge.ipynb


## Results

#### Pyber Summary DataFrame

Based on these results we can see that:
- Urban cities have the highest total rides, drivers, and fares
- Rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and driver
- Suburban city totals and averages are average overall compared to urban and rural cities

#### Total Fare by City Type

Based on these results we can see that:
- Urban cities have consistently high fares overtime
- Rural city fares remain consistently low with their lowest total fares occuring in the middle/end of January.
- Suburban city fares remain at an average fare rate compared to urban and rural cities and experienced a slight drop in total fares in late February.


## Summary
Based on these results, I can propose the following business recommendations:
- For rural cities - more advertising and marketing could be beneficial since rides and total fares are so low. It also may be beneficial to offer rural specific discounts or promotions to draw in more business. Since their lowest total fares occurred at the end of January, it may be a good opportunity to offer discounts centered around New Years Eve or "New Years Promotions" to spike up revenue during that time.
- For suburban cities - it also may be beneficial to incorporate more advertising and marketing in those areas as well as offer more incentives for suburban people to become drivers in the area to increase business.
- For urban cities - since the total rides and fares are already high, it might be beneficial to offer discounts or promotions that encourage even more people to choose Pyber over its competitors.
